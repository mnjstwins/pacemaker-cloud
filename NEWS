I'd like to spend a moment to tell you about a new project myself and Angus
Salkeld are working on.  The project, called the Pacemaker Cloud Policy
Engine, is a cloud-specific policy engine and will act as a sub-project
of the Pacemaker project.

We are doing a ground-up implementation of a cloud policy manager, using a
few other open source building block components.

Our dependencies are:
QPID/QMF (provides a management bus for communication of the various components)
Upstart (provides a mechanism to launch our internal processes)
Pacemaker Policy Engine (provides a mechanism for us to make policy decisions)
Matahari (provides a mechanism to monitor VM images)

We have decided on a general model for managing cloud deployments:
Assembly: A VM image with a Matahari instance
Deployable: Collection of Assemblies

We are working on 5 components at the moment:
1. QMF model of the methods/events for various components
2. CLI Shell
2.1 requests the CPE start a deployable
2.2 requests the CPE stop a deployable
2.3 Displays assembly failures
3. Cloud Policy Engine
3.1 starts a deployable policy engine
3.2 Stops a deployable policy engine
4. VM Launcher
4.1 Starts VM images
5. Deployable Policy Engine
5.1 Requests VM launcher to start images
5.2 Monitors a VM image via matahari
5.3 Starts applications via matahari
5.4 Stops applications via matahari
5.5 Recovers failures detected by matahari managed applications
5.6 Uses the Pacemaker policy engine library to make decisions about which
    sort of matahari actions to take
